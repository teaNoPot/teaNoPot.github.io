# Living in the under-world

"They call it the underworld, " his wife claimed, "Would you believe that?"

 Under the silk sheets, Jonas curled into her loving arms, lavender and vanilla playfully danced around his nose, "I'll call it whatever you do" he pointed out in that sweet voice of his.

 The flesh disease was what she had meant, a harrowing anomaly, that grew out of human greed and lust. They called emergency on it a few years back, but none had experienced it so the public dismissed it as another one of the gouvernement's *misdirections*. 

 Jonas' loving wife had been following the progress ever since, three years it has been, though Jonas himself has been against it, telling her "Stop on it, like the moon landing, and the other dozen follies they had been feeding us.", after a heated night, he would just end his words with agreements, "The only disease I believe in is cuddling-us, say is it contagious?" he'd joke with his wife, before waking up to the silence of the night.

Perhaps it had been a controversy, yet if his wife believed in it, nay if she invested enough time around it, hell, it is important after all. You can't go wrong believing the person you love.

If only he had truly listened.

There she lay asleep in his arms, and it reminded him of their first days. Back when the trees were green, and light blushed from the clouds. Back when his heart wavered at the song of birds, and the flaking dust on the streets. Where did it all go? What went so wrong?

She was a beauty, a handsome flare sparked from her smile, her soul brought true butterflies, he couldn't leave his eyes an instant without a glance at her shoulders, her velvet silk robe at times, her low tied dresses and those beautiful laces that went just as well. 

Now she lay into his arms, eyes closed, mouth open, and soul broken. "What did I do wrong?" he shouted at the void behind her lids, "What could I ever do"

Her flesh caught on the disease, her arms slowly degraded with no one's notice. She gradually covered her arms, but Jonas never noticed. "Please put the lamp light out, it burns me at night" she'd said, and he'd always assume it meant a heated night. And how could he ever know what it truly had meant? 

He knew in the heart of his heart if he listened, if he truly did, he would've looked with her. All those years, one day was all it took him to see her pain, her scars. 

*What does it matter anymore* , he thought staring into her hollowed cheeks, the pale skin, arms torn, shoulder blades popped, knees, toes, thighs. 

"What were you doing?" 
"Why weren't you seeing her?"
He didn't know, he truly didn't, he reminded himself every time, when the police came, when her family came, and when the neighbours came. 
What's a husband doing not noticing the little details? 

What would he say to that, that he was, in love?

The clouds darkened his eyes, he stared at them now from his cell. the bright clouds, gone with the wind, gone with the pink memories and white smiles. Gone.

Under the hardened reality, he found himself living in the underworld, just like his wife had said. The underworld exited, and if it did, then he had caught the disease too. That would explain the flock of agents at his doorsteps, and the extensive restrictions put on his collar. No visitors, no one knew where he was. Jonas didn't know where Jonas was either, but his wife had already known.

The cell was empty, small, tall, white, long, and void of all. It made him whole, empty like the shell he was. I just wished I could see it, for one day, he'd ponder that thought for days, or months, he couldn't tell with the clouds roaming and no sun outside the cell top hole. It could be true, it could be a dream. Who would say? 

The days gradually felt heavy, his legs grew shaky, and his hair fell unconditionally. And he had wished it was of age. The only thing he had on that cell is a platter box that opened at times from what appeared to be a locked door. There was no knob, no border, no nothing. as if the wall swallowed the metal whole. And the darkness didn't help either.

The only confort he had was the memories of his wife's conspiracies, how she believed the flesh would dissolve the body, and in under a week the host would suffer the pain of dehydration and open bacterias. He had none yet, but if it is only a week to rejoin his wife, he'd sworn to endure. 

And endure he did. His hands gotten stickier on the walls, if he pushed harder, few cells of skin and hair would hug the wall and leave the fingers bare. He slowly thrown his shirt, then his pants, then his boxers. Nothing could make him comfortable, any thing that touched his skin had taken some of it, like wolves shredding at a lamb.

Pain grew at every shed of skin and sweat, his body heated up at every turn, he stopped walking, yet couldn't sleep, not stand. Each time he did, a tear from his bottom would occur, the pain grew immensely that he couldn't keep up with what side was stolen. The stench of it was foul, and he couldn't bear look at any of it. He thanked the clouds for not shining the atrocities this cell had become. The empty void is filled with pieces of himself.

And days grew harder, his blinking caused him pain, his lips stickier than ever, he couldn't open them anymore. If he did, he'd lose the last remaining source of hydration. Nobody tock on that wall, nobody cared to send him food. Or perhaps they did, just that the pain was so excruciating it stopped his senses. 

Jonas never cared for his body, but at his last blink, he heard his wife's last words, "I don't want to leave you for the underworld."
