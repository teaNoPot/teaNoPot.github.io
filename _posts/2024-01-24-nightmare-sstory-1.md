# A Graveyard Shift

On a Thursday morning, Josh and his family went on their regular graveyard work. For over five years, they had taken the ugly job of cleaning mud and dirt off the cemetery. 
Josh was never okay with his parents’ decision, but he followed his mother nonetheless. It was better their working night shifts, and flowers were particularly comforting him.

This morning was different. Clouds absorbed the remaining light, and Josh’s flowers slowly faded into gray.
“You know what happens to those slacking off” Jeremy pointed out, his beard blackened by all the dirt.

“They sleep under dirt,” Josh responded to the old man, “better be with them, than clean after the dead.”

Josh’s father had been far older than he had hoped, over sixteen yet his back truly pained him. At least that’s what he said to Josh.

“It’s okay love,” Samara Flinch reassured Jeremy, “they must be exhausted” she put in.

Josh always had a smile on his face, whenever his mother would join them. Sometimes she didn’t, or she couldn’t. Over the past year, she was diagnosed with sciatica in her back. Josh assumed it was the reason his father wouldn’t admit to his back pain.

“It’s alright mother,” Josh replied, “I’ll go help Alex southyard”

The graveyard of Sinnster town was rather wide for a small town’s cemetery. Regularly, people came in to either put a new loved one under, or to mourn for an already gone soul. And for the past few years, it has become more and more frequent. The south of the graveyard was slowly filled with love and sorrow.

“Have you finished this site Alex?” Josh asked

“Can’t you tell?” Alex replied with a hint of a smile,”Or perhaps you can’t see the difference between clean and disgusting.”

Josh didn’t raise the taunt. He had worked long enough with his brother to know his words.
“I came to help” Josh replied, “If you’re done here, I’ll cover the left side.”

Alex shrugged at Josh, he hadn’t been in the best of moods lately.

Josh observed a lot of comers today, families wearing black suits, black dresses, and even black flowers. They wept tears at the footsteps of their dead, then left tracks of their littering. Some brought in food, some threw random holistic objects.

Josh waited for them to finish their mourning then swept in with a rag to clean the remaining.
He also put back the flowers on the top of the tomb.

Over the left south, Josh had cleared all the tombs, save for one. He had come to know of this one tomb, because of its spotless form.

Nothing seemed to dirty it. Nobody approached it. It had become his place of comfort, where he hid during the day from his family, and from Alex.
During the day shift, Josh had a few minutes of silence where he stored into the valley of the dead.

But today had gotten quieter than usual, clouds condensed around Josh.

“What happens when the living dies” Josh muttered the words to the silent tomb, not expecting an answer.

Josh never saw the names of them, he tried not making faces of them. His mother told him that it hurts less when sitting near them every week, and cleaning their sorrows.
Josh adhered to this rule, except for this one tomb.

He saw the name for the first time, “Justin Linch” it wrote.

He felt extremely close to it, given it’s last name is one word away from joining his family.
“You slacking Josh,” the young man’s voice came cracking at Josh like a whip, “why aren’t you helping your own family.”

“I’m just resting”Josh replied, “besides I’ve already finished my day’s quota, seventy tombs spotless.”

“Who told you of any quota?” Alex glared at Josh’s careless demeanor.

“I made the quota” Josh smirked watching back the tomb, he felt like he just won at this comeback.

Drops fell down, and soon enough the sky cried a river.

Alex stood above Josh, angry.

A meteor hit Josh’s chest before he could look back up, pain growling at his chest from the boot kick he just had received. He fell into the grave’s memorial wall, blood gushing into the edges. Josh got back up, slowly, pain numbing his face and tightening his eyes. As the rain washed away blood and dirt, his vision cleared, and there he saw it.

Memories came back rushing.

“Justin Flinch”, Josh said slowly, “My real brother.”
