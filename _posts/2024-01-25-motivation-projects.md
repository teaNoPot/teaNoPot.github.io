# Odette to Finishing my damn projects

Let's tackle one of my biggest issues :

### Getting the motivation to finish non started/finished projects

It feels as though moving from one idea to the next is a getaway. Whenever I've found difficulties, I ran away and justified it by finding a *better* looking project.

> My attention to something easily dwindles whenever I become *unsatisfied* with the learning process.

But I have come to accept this, and I will work slowly to guiding myself to finishing them. The projects. 

### My current solution to the damn motivation

- Start manageable projects or *break* complicated existing ones.
- It's okay to have many ambitious goals.

As with anything in life, part of solving a problem is identifying it correctly.

The problem I'm facing is how to make use of **time** in a way that will benefit my future self the most, as well as the me right now.

Few questions pop up :

- What if I have to *sacrifice* my present for my future ?
- Do I have to *balance* them ?
- Or do I *sacrifice* my future for my present?

Each of these questions had introduced different perspectives to the one problem, yet they also introduced more in-depth questions :

- Is it my desires I want fulfilled ?
- Or is it my ideals ?
- Is it the need to prove to myself that I stand above my family ? 
- Or perhaps the innate ability to win in every domain ? Spiritual, financial, and creative ?
- Is what satisfies me the identity of the achiever ?
- The social image of the unique ?
- The hero of change ? the influencer ?

And if it is indeed these questions I am trying to answer, then, What do I strive to be? All of what is humanly achievable? And would I care about any of it?

As you fully noticed, answering any question related to this particular problem only yield more questions. And the reason as I've mentioned is the definition of the problem : **Motivation to finish**

I don't think humans are capable of truly finishing something, since we do not understand the end truly. Rather our end is death, and even then, it pushed our brains to ponder on the question of *What happens after death?*

I believe it is all related to this problem, since we cannot truly understand the ending, we look at it from a different perspective :

The end is the conclusion of the project. If it were a product (a pen for example) then it is the process from the start of gathering the materials and passing through a set of instruction to finally having a product that executes what was intended for it to do. The end there isn't an end, rather a conclusion.

So when I've looked at the end in a way that isn't an **end**, I've come to realize of the motivation behind it. 

To finish a project is not to answer my questions, my identity. Rather to finish a project is to answer part of our end, and if our life had the big end, what type of finishes would I want to do. 

My identity is not only shaped by my consciousness, but by the interaction between present points. The present creates past and inferes a future, and that relationship is all made possible by the small finished of the present.

### Conclusion (Finish)

We will all take a different approach to resolving creative/non creative projects, but the same methods will be used : Looking at the project from the present lens means we need manageable chunks for that present.

Motivation comes by itself when I realize the payoff for the current project.
